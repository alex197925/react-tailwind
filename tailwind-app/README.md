# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Installation
## Get started with Tailwind CSS
[Link tailwind installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

1. Install Tailwind CSS
 * Install tailwindcss and its peer dependencies via npm, and then run the init command to generate both tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.

````typescript
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
````

2. Configure your template paths
 * Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.

````typescript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
````

3. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
 * Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your ./src/index.css file.

```typescript
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

4. Start using Tailwind in your project
 * Start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.

````typescript
export default function App() {
  return (
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Hello world!
    </h1>
  )
}
````

6. RESTART SERVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Using Global Style

---- index.css
````typescript
/*Global Style*/
@layer base {
    body {
        @apply
        font-[Poppins]
    }

    li {
        @apply
        p-4
    }

    h1 {
        @apply
        font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl
